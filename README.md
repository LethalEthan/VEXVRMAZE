# VEXVRMAZE

Currently, the code uses basic left hand wall following technique to map out the maze into a 2D 8x8 matrix. The code will then generate an output in the console to show the mapping and display it works.

I haven't been able to implement a working path finding algorithm to find the fastest route, however I did try developing a path traversal algorithm but I couldn't get it to work unfortunately.
