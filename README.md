# VEXVRMAZE

Currently, the code uses basic left hand wall following technique to map out the maze into a 2D 8x8 array. I have attempted to output in the console what the bot has marked but unfortunately it doesn't work properly and I've tried many times.

I haven't been able to implement djikstras algorithm to find the fastest route, I did try to apply for an extension but on my student record but it hasn't worked but I did want to implement this.
